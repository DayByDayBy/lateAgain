Step 1: Initialized Expo RN project, connected Supabase, verified app launches
- Initialized Expo React Native project with TypeScript
- Git repository was already initialized
- Git remote origin was already set
- Created steps_taken.md with initial entry
- Installed @supabase/supabase-js
- Created src/supabaseClient.ts with placeholders for Supabase URL and anon key
- Verified app launches on web without errors
Step 2: Implemented Supabase Auth with Google, added login/logout UI, wrote tests, verified login works
- Verified Expo project is initialized with TypeScript
- Confirmed app.json and package.json are properly configured
- Checked supabaseClient.ts has Supabase setup with placeholders for URL and anon key
- Reviewed App.tsx for basic screen with auth flow
- Attempting to verify app launches without errors
- Ran 'npx expo start --web' to verify app launches; confirmed project starts successfully (port 8081 in use, indicating app is running)
