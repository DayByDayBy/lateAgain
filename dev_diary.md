## Blockers and Resolutions

- Git push auth: Assumed resolved as per logs.
- Test mock issues: Partially fixed, some tests still failing.

## Review Findings
- Strengths: Good architecture, testing coverage.
- Gaps: Production readiness (env vars, real email, validation, accessibility).

## Conclusion
MVP completed with core features. Ready for extensions.
## Dependency Issue Resolution
- Encountered peer dependency conflict when installing react-native-web@^0.20.0 and @expo/metro-runtime@~5.0.4 due to React version mismatch (React 19.0.0 vs required 19.1.1 for react-dom).
- Resolved by installing with --legacy-peer-deps flag.

### Step 19: UI Design Improvements

  - Applied beautiful gradient background (purple to blue) using LinearGradient
  - Added bus_stop_trace.svg as subtle background framing in top left corner
  - Adjusted Google button width to 80% with enhanced styling and shadows
  - Improved typography with larger, bold title and better font weights
  - Enhanced button styles with rounded corners, shadows, and better spacing
  - Updated toggle buttons with glassmorphism effect and smooth transitions
  - Improved form container with semi-transparent background and better padding
  - Enhanced input fields with better styling and transparency
  - Ensured responsive design with fixed max-width for web compatibility
- Current project status: MVP with core features complete, UI significantly improved
- App running successfully on web (port 8082) with no runtime errors
- Next steps: Complete remaining todos (record steps, git commit) and consider production readiness features
